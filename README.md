# Project - Connectionist Bench (Sonar-Mines vs. Rocks)

The objective is to develop a network capable of distinguishing between sonar signals reflected by a metal cylinder and those reflected by a roughly cylindrical rock.

• Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.

• Trained multiple classification models and evaluated their accuracy using K-Fold cross-validation.

• Following model validation, SVM yielded the most promising results. To further refine its accuracy, model tuning was performed.

• Subsequently, the model was saved using the pickle library.
