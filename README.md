# Project - Connectionist Bench (Sonar-Mines vs. Rocks)

• The task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals 
bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical 
rock.

• Done EDA, Feature Engineering, trained various classification models 
and calculated their accuracy by using K-Fold model validation 
technique.

• After model validation, SVM gives best result but for enhancing its 
accuracy more, tuning of model was done.

• Then saved the model using pickle library.
